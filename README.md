# Variable Importance

## Considerations

### Units Shouldn't Matter

If you are trying to understand the importance of a variable say a persons height on their risk of fall injury. The importance should be the same wether height is measured in feet or meters. 

### Many Models Are "Good"; No Model is "Right"

Variable importance should take into consideration model choice, if a variable can be replaced in a model with another variable and the model is equally predictive then those swappable variables should be given similar importance.
